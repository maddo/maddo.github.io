Soon, you'll see a post here about me roasting my own coffee beans. It's coming, but not quite yet.

In the meantime, I heartily recommend Moustache Coffee Club. I've been ordering coffee from them for over a year now. I even sent short subscriptions to a couple of friends for Christmas. They source their beans from (US) west coast roasters and every new bag has been the best coffee I've ever had in my life. I get one bag per month and supplement each month with some local beans, for variety.

Try these beans:

Let's talk about brewing methods soon, too.
