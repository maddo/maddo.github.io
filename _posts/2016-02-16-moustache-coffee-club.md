Soon, you'll see a post here about me roasting my own coffee beans. It's coming, but not quite yet.

In the meantime, I heartily recommend Moustache Coffee Club. I've been ordering beans from them since September 2014. This Christmas I even gifted short subscriptions to a couple of friends.

They initially ask for a basic idea of what flavors you like, then they choose and send you beans on the schedule you choose. They source their beans from (US) west coast roasters. I get one bag per month and supplement each month with some local beans, for variety.

Every new bag-o-beans has been amazing. Try them out!

Let's talk about brewing methods soon, too.
