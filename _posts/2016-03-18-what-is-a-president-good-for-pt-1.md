I've never paid much attention to politics. Presidential elections brought me in the same way that the Super Bowl pulls in non-fans - it's a Big Show. This is important to realize.

However, in accordance with the general pattern of "the internet makes all things more visible," this election cycle has been prominently unavoidable. And it's caused me to dig in a bit.

If you (like me) are starting in the dark, check out [The Skimm's 2016 Elections Guide](http://www.theskimm.com/2016-election) for a damn good summary of a lot of the moving parts.

Over the next couple of days I will write about the [DNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee), [Lessig](http://www.lessig.org/about/), Sanders vs Clinton, Trump and the [GOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)).
