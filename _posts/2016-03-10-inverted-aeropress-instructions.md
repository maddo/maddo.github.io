My friend [Shon](http://shonm.com/) turned me on to both the [Aeropress](http://www.aerobie.com/product/aeropress/) and the inverted method of brewing. The inverted method refers literally to rotating the device 180 degrees from the standard instructions.

Please read through the entire instructions before attempting this method.

Let's start by identifying the Aeropress components.

* Plunger - tube capped by a rubber seal on one end, the other end flanged to accommodate the application of pressure by hand
* Chamber - larger diameter tube into which the plunger is inserted. One end is plain, the other is also flanged.
* Filter Cap - into which is placed a filter, then screwed onto the flanged end of the Chamber.
* Filter - one-use paper filters
* Stirrer - for mild agitation of the brew
