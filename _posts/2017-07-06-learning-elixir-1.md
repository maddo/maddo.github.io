Browsing hacker news, I came across [Learning Elixir: My side-project](http://adrian-philipp.com/post/learning-elixir-first-side-project) and it motivated me dig deeper into elixir. My day job involves a lot of PHP and a fair amount of devops type work, and it has been ages since I've set out to learn something really different.

My next stop was [Why Elixer](http://theerlangelist.com/article/why_elixir) from the Erlangelist, Saša Jurić. This juicy post got me more and more excited while spinning off mini-research missions into things like macros in C++ and abstract tree syntax - subjects I've only barely brushed up against.

I then talked to my friend and elixir user Mike Dwyer and bemoaned my complete lack of footing in the world of elixir. I know not of elixir or erlang and my functional programming experience is limited and rusty! Adrian Phillipp's blog post was great for motivation, but I wasn't sure where to start. Dwyer recommended Dave Thomas' "Programming Elixir," and then pointed me to a series in DailyDrip which provides a free intro in short daily posts: [Introduction to Elixir](https://hackernoon.com/a-free-introduction-to-elixir-otp-ecto-and-phoenix-228d0e994fc1). Day-one is a cinch ;) In the closing notes is an unmissable video of [Carl Hewitt answering questions about the actor model!!](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Hewitt-Meijer-and-Szyperski-The-Actor-Model-everything-you-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask)
