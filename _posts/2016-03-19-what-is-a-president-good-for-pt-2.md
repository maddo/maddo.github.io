The first unpleasant revelation of this election cycle was the corruption of the Democratic National Convention. The DNC [strong-armed candidate Lessig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig_presidential_campaign,_2016#Out) right out of the race.

* lessig wanted to run a referendum presidency
* lessig wanted to tackle campaign finance reform first and only
* in order to be accepted into the DNC, you must meet the rules of the DNC
* which includes grabbing 1% interest in national polls
* the polls must be given by national media outlets
* who would be directly affected by campaign finance reform
* since a lion's share of campaign finances go into media ad buys
* so they didn't put him in the polls (except for one, which he did get the requisite 1% on)

It makes me want to scream a bit that my own convention blocked the candidate I was most interested in. By circuitous and deceptive means.
