Today I learned why bumblebees pump their abdomens. I was prompted to look it up after one sat down next to me and started to dance suggestively. I wondered if I was somehow even attractive to other species, for a moment. Then I found out they do it to warm up their flight muscles, which made sense, even if it did hurt my feelings a little bit. ([source](http://www.bumblebee.org/bodyTempReg.htm))
