Happy leap day. I'm struggling to write every day, if I'm being honest. However, today my friend Martyn showed me his shiny new Github Pages [blog](http://martynchamberlin.com/) and it inspired to do some leap day cleaning (read: copy some nice elements of his layout and jekyll usage).

Changes:

* Home page no shows latest posts
* Archive page
* Updated footer to link to the Archive page and the RSS feed

Thanks Martyn! Here's hoping this helps jump-start my stalled blogging motor.
