During a conversation with my buddy Mike, regarding task management software and processes, (a recurring theme), he invoked YNAB's first rule, applying it to time management. [You Need a Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com) (YNAB) is phenomenal budgeting software, deserving of its own post - I'll just gloss over its rules, for now.

YNAB's rules:

1. Give Every Dollar a Job.
2. Embrace Your True Expenses.
3. Roll with the Punches.
4. Age your money. (Used to be: Save for a Rainy Day)

Money is a resource. Maybe YNAB's rules work for other resources. Maybe Mike is onto something big here. Let's swap in time, for money.

1. Give Every Minute a Job.
2. Embrace the True Nature of your Tasks
3. Roll with the Punches.
4. Not sure how to save time...

How can you apply these rules?

### Give Every Minute a Job

Start your day by planning. You're going to work x hours, you have a list of y things to do, plan your day. Put in a lunch block. Mark when you're going to stop.

### Embrace the True Nature of your Tasks

Optimism can be frustrating if it causes you to underestimate your tasks.

### Roll with the Punches

Estimating is always hard, unexpected demands creep up. Use planning tools that make it easy to move tasks around!

I think the perfect time and task management tool would incorporate these points.
