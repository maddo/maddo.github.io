Quick look at the steps for baking my sourdough. My starter was homegrown from water, flour and patience.

### Shaped!

*Bread is set near the oven as it pre-heats to 450F, 30 full minutes*

### Quick Reshape Before Cooking

*Right before going in, quick reshape if necessary*

*Ok, maybe not so carefully*

*Ideally for hours, but it never makes it too far beyond initial cooling*

### Cut and Serve

*This was a delicious loaf!*

This is the what. I'll add a post about the how, later.
