I'm a bit obsessed with task management. I've worked with countless pieces of software, paper notebooks, misused software not intended for task management, and even used a [print and fold organizing document](http://www.pocketmod.com/) for a while.

I've been toying with the idea of developing my own software. If you are a software developer and none of the existing solutions sooth all your pain points, you sort of have an obligation to create it.

Planning the features of this software, however, has sent me in the unexpected direction of *trying out all the task management software in the world*. This might seem counterintuitive, but here are two good reasons:

1. Maybe someone already created the perfect app
2. Even the worst app might have at least one very good idea

So, the journey to stop wasting time on new productivity apps has led me directly down the path of trying out new productivity apps. It's like some nerdy, uninteresting version of [Final Destination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Destination).
