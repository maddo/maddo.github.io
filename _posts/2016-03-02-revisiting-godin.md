Two weeks ago I mentioned some useful daily habits I was working on. Here's a quick update on how that's going:

### Daily podcast time

Going strong. Excellent source of new data for my brain to munch on. Generally listening to productivity, finance or humor. I'll list the podcasts I actually listen to regularly at the end.

### Practicing Dvorak

Great - I can now type with the dvorak, but slowly. Continuing to practice to pick up speed. Using [the typing cat typing tutor](http://thetypingcat.com/course) and chatting for at least a few minutes a day with the layout selected. Painfully slow, but working.

### Headspace.com

I picked up a subscription [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com) to keep going, and now I'm into 15 minute sessions. I miss a day here or there - I seem to do well if I hit this early in the morning. I'm already noticing that the days I miss my session tend to be more scatterbrained days. Chicken or egg?

### Crossfit

Going strong. Minimum of 2 days a week, and Gaby and I are setting the goal of going 3 days a week for all of March. We're putting this month in turbo mode by adding [Whole 30](http://whole30.com/). We [did it once before](http://whole30food.blogspot.com/) and loved it!

### Writing every day?

Well, writing is, by far, my most public promise, and the archives are embarrassingly light. It's difficult to create a new post every day. I struggle to have something worth writing about every single day. But the point is that you can't be a good writer without first being a bad writer, and to be a bad writer, you have to write.
