# Mike Jablecki

A programmer by trade, an amateur musician, photographer, cook, board and video gamer, productivity nut and incredibly lucky husband.

Interested in the internet from the beginning. It's a privilege to have seen the world both before and after the internet changed it. When interviewing for my first job with a tech company, the hiring manager specifically remarked, "you really love internet." It seemed strange to hear it then, but in retrospect it was a most keen observation.
